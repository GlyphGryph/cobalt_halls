What are the basic gameplay loops?
What decisions does the player need to make, and how do we make those decisions interesting, empowering, or engaging?
What kind of playstyles do want to explicitly support?
- "SAGE: Figuring out the world": Through exploration, observation, and exchanging knowledge, we want players to be able to change things that are initially confusing or mysterious about the world into things they understand and can use to their advantage, with a sense of escalating power through knowledge and discovery, some of it "ensouled" (in the player) but also in a way that is somehow linked to the character so they can later experience it again (the changing world might provide this component).
It might also be worth having outside-of-game elements and some sort of hidden past that can only be loosely assembled from clues for players who REALLY want to dig deep. World As Is (State of Play), World As It Could Be (Mechanical Potential), and World As It Was (history and lore, player created and otherwise)
- "PROVIDER: Building community and building connections": Through construction, teaching, resource collection, and acquiring useful knowledge, we want players to be able to feel like they are building something and supporting others who need support. That because of them, the group they belong to and the members of it are stronger, more capable, and better off. We should have ways to recognize their contributions, and a diversity of means to contribute, so they can feel good and useful playing in the ways closest to the ones they also get mechanical enjoyment from.
- "THESPIAN: Playing a role": We want players to, if they wish, fully inhabit their characters, to act and create engaging drama and socialize with others and create a story that is fun to be a part of, something chaotic and largely not mechanical itself, but supported by the mechanics. Opportunities for dramatic turns, shifting allegiances (at least in small ways), political vying, benefits from engaging socially and for small thematically enhancing roleplay. This role especially requires buy in from other players to work at all, so we need to support that, since satisfaction as an actor often requires a supportive audience and other players. This player wants to *feel* like a kobold, and feel rewarded for *being* their kobold. (some of the Entity mechanics could go a long way to supporting this)
- "COMMANDER: Leading, organizing, and delegating": We want players to feel powerful not just in their own characters, but for those who want it, in their roles within the clan. It is one thing to not have to do busywork, but it feels better sometimes for busywork to exist but for you to be able to relax knowing that someone else is handling it and you are benefitting because you set up the system to make it happen. We want to reward coordination, automation, understanding and planning so these kinds of players can be seen as valuable even when they themselves barely play the game. Why should they need to? The factory... err, tribe must grow! We need to make sure it is obvious to them what when they are succeeding and when they are failing as well, since their role is inherently less direct and they are playing less as themselves and more as the tribe itself.

How much should be left to chance, or other factors outside a player's control?
How do we encourage solidarity among group members?

Basic Play Approaches:
Resource Management: What are the core resources and resource categories? How do we make acquiring them engaging? What are they being acquired for? What are the primary challenges? (reaching them? transporting them? organizing them? Identifying them?)
Social interaction and coordination: What tools can be made available to promote or inhibit coordination in an engaging way?
Do we want mechanical character growth? What balance of lateral and vertical?
How do we balance synchronous and asynchronous interactions so that players can still enjoy playing more, but playrs who can play less can still see benefits and feel like they can fully engage with the game?
How do we create the right "vibes" and feelings? For example, these are kobolds - even if we thought eating was pointless mechanically, we *want* some sort of hunting or trapping mechanic, because if you can't hunt or trap would you even *feel* like a kobold? But it can be highly abstracted if needed, or we can abstract the boring bits (eating) and lean into the fun bits (some sort of hunting puzzle)

Fundamentally, this will NOT be a combat gaem. Fights will be rare. Most threats will be dealt with by avoidance, cunning, indirect means, or rapid application of force. Hunts will be about finding and catching prey, not fighting it.

Gameplay progression:
The first order of business for a kobold in a new world is to build a den.
Second is to scout for a location to start building a settlement. (settlements can be moved later, but it becomes more difficult the more developed the settlement is)
Creating a new settlement involves:
  - Exploration - finding relevant dangers, resources, room layouts and space to expand, access to other regions, possible borders with other tribes and factions
  - Resource collection
  - Construction of necessary buildings, tools, defenses, and identifiers
Settlements will eventually cover several rooms

UNSORTED IDEAS:
Have most rooms large enough to be extended vertically so players can build/climb up.

Have players able to teach skill (like climbing) to young kobolds at camp.

The tides roam around the region and create danger, with combined tides reaching higher becoming deadlier.

Kobolds can log off relatively safely in a "den", which can be created in any suitable location, but the safest dens will be rarer and harder to build, only available in certain locations, and are required to protect from every danger - all creatures, storms, floods, and other dangers.

Speaking of rooms, we need to figure out sizing. 

Territory markers - visual and scent based?

Traps and a way to mechanically pass on knowledge to other kobolds in order to avoid them.

Construction of walls and gates across open access points, and clearing out of closed access points.

Make smell important! Able to tell who has been in the area recently and track them. Ability to label kobolds and other creatures by scent.

Hunting - By default, hunted creatures should just turn into generic "meat", to signify they are not important individually and do not need to be considered further, at least initially. Some creatures might have other uses - they should be kept as is unless intentionally changed into generic meat so players know to suspect they are something special. If we end up adding cooking mechanics, we might want to introduce multiple varieties of special ingredients as well, but it should still be kept as simple as possible until it mechanically needs to be otherwise.

Ask some questions at the beginning and then run the player through any of several custommized tutorials?
